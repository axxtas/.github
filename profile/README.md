# Jump Apps - building apps that last.

With Jump Apps, it's our goal to build apps that last. This means they are designed to improve the life of a user for a long time and have a purpose.

We are currently building the first app named "coodev". To stay updated on that you can check out the [Jump Apps](https://www.linkedin.com/company/jump-apps/) LinkedIn account.

If you have any further question, feel free to reach out.
